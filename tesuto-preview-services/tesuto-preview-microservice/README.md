This is the backing student content microservice implementation abstracted and configurable.

This image assumes that the code from this project has already built the Spring Boot Service jar.

## Environment Variables

Note that OPS will not allow Docker images to contain sensitive data such as passwords, therefore some of these variables will be removed in the near future.

## Setup

The data model will create itself when run for the first time. The datasource is defined by three environment variables. These must be set before running the service. 

```shell
export ASSESS_USER_SERVICE_DB_USERNAME=<your username>
export ASSESS_USER_SERVICE_DB_PASSWORD=<your password>
export ASSESS_USER_SERVICE_DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://<your host>:5432/cccacct
```

WARNING: developers running this locally should ALWAYS set the env var RUN_FLYWAY to true in order to get the correct database model

## Proxy
If the service will be run behind a proxy then the following environment variables need to be set.

```shell
ASSESS_USER_SERVICE_PROXY=<proxy host name>
ASSESS_USER_SERVICE_PROXY_PORT=<proxy port>
ASSESS_USER_SERVICE_PROXY_SCHEME=<http or https depending on the proxy>
```

## Usage

See [Maketools Overview](./maketools/) for additional usage details

### Build the java artifact
```shell
$ mvn clean package
```

### Build image
```shell
$ make build
```

Alternately, you can do the maven and image creation all at once via:
```shell
$ make build-all
```

### Run container
```shell
$ docker run -p 8089:8089 -e SERVICES_SERVER=http://services.ccctech.org -e SMS_VERSION=v1 <registry-hostname>/service-studentCONTENT:<tag>
```
or
```shell
$ make run OPT="-p 8089:8089 -e SERVICES_SERVER=http://services.ccctech.org -e SMS_VERSION=v1"
```
